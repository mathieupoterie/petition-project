## Overview

Petition - Full stack project where users can sign a petition and then access to all the sign-ups.

I really enjoyed this project, this was the first time I got into the module concept, having a deep understanding of a website structure.

## Detail

I used in this project several technologies:
- JQuery for interacting with the DOM, HTML handlebars, connected to backend files (using Node JS), rendering information from the database (PostgreSQL).
- Handeblars to render dynamically the webpages from the server side. Using queries to render different content according to the situation.
- CSS, media queries for making the website responsive.



This petition is a simple website, where you can create an account by registering. You can also sign in.

<p>After creating an account, you can sign the petition. I really enjoyed this part of the project, using canvas to create this signature field. You can erase your signature, or submit it. After submiting it, you go to the next step, where you can see your signature. For that part, I stored the signature image code in the database, to render it to this page. This is what it looks like.</p>
