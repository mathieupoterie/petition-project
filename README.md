## Synopsis

Petition - Fullstack project where users can sign a petition and then access to all the sign-ups.
I used in this project several technologies:
o JQuery for interacting with the DOM, HTML handlebars, connected to backend files, rendering information from the database.
o Handeblars to render dynamically the webpages from the server side. Using queries to render different content according to the situation.
o CSS, media queries for making the website responsive.

I really enjoyed this project, this was the first time I got into the module concept, having a deep understandting of a website structure.
